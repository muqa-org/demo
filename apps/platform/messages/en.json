    "title": "Frequently asked questions",
    "zazelenimo": "What is Zazelenimo?",
    "zazelenimoAnswer1": "Zazelenimo is an online application for the implementation of participatory budgeting programs in cities.",
    "zazelenimoAnswer2": "The special feature of Zazelenimo, compared to other applications that have the same purpose, is the use of Ethereum and a special form of voting called square funding.",
    "participatory": "What is participatory budgeting?",
    "participatoryAnswer1": "Participatory budgeting is a form of involving citizens in deciding on the distribution of budget funds of public authorities.",
    "participatoryAnswer2": "PB most often implies that citizens propose and then vote on proposals for communal and other types of projects that will be implemented in the local community from the joint budget.",
    "ethereum": "What is Ethereum?",
    "ethereumAnswer": "Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). In the Zazelenimo application, it is used to ensure the transparency and security of voting and funding. Every transaction and vote is recorded on the blockchain, which enables a clear and secure overview of all activities.",
    "quadratic": "What is quadratic Funding?",
    "quadraticAnswer": "Quadratic funding is an innovative voting and funding system where the strength of each vote depends on the number of supporters, not the size of an individual donation. This means that projects that get more support with smaller amounts from more citizens have a better chance of getting funding than projects that depend on large donations from a small number of people. The goal is to enable a more equal and fair financing system.",
    "participate": "Who can participate in Zazelenimo?",
    "participateAnswer": "Anyone can propose a project, participate in the elaboration of any proposal and vote for the proposals that are offered for voting.",
